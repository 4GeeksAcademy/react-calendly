## FAQ

#### Why are my page settings not working?

For the page settings to work, you'll need to pass in a `url` prop that is associated with a Calendly account on the [Pro plan](https://calendly.com/pages/pricing).

#### How do I create a custom button that triggers a pop-up scheduler?

`react-calendly` provides an `openPopupWidget` function that can be used to trigger the pop-up scheduler.

```tsx
import { openPopupWidget } from 'react-calendly';

const CustomButton = ({ url, prefill, pageSettings, utm }) => {
  const onClick = () => openPopupWidget({ url, prefill, pageSettings, utm });

  return <button onClick={onClick}>Custom Button</button>
}
```
